# 2D Pong Game
## Description
A simple 2D game to get familiar with game development basics. The game is built using Python and features a basic gameplay where two players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth.

## Features
* Simple gameplay with two paddles and a ball
* Scorekeeping and display
* Basic collision detection
* Player input using keyboard arrows

## Tech Stack
* Python 3.x
* Pygame library for game development

## Installation Instructions
To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Install Python 3.x from the official Python website if you haven't already.
2. Install the required Pygame library by running `pip install pygame` in your terminal.
3. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/2d-pong-game.git`.
4. Navigate to the project directory using `cd 2d-pong-game`.

## Usage Examples
To run the game, use the command `python main.py`. Use the up and down arrow keys to control the left paddle, and the W and S keys to control the right paddle.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following directories and files:
* `main.py`: The main game loop and logic.
* `paddle.py`: The paddle class definition.
* `ball.py`: The ball class definition.
* `score.py`: The scorekeeping class definition.
* `requirements.txt`: The list of required libraries.

## Configuration
No specific configuration is required to run the project.

## Testing Instructions
To test the game, run `python main.py` and play the game. You can also write unit tests for the individual classes (e.g., `paddle.py`, `ball.py`) using Python's built-in `unittest` module.

## Future Improvements
* Implement AI opponents
* Add sound effects and music
* Create a menu system for game options
* Improve graphics and visuals
